					Where ‘Maldoror’ penetrates its six lips, the lush sunshine tilts along the floor, briefly overlapping with the etheric plane. Here are the bodies that ‘greet another day, another morning after death.’ They were the farmers who tilled the soil of creativity. 
					<br><br>
					As the birth mother measures her daughter’s energy flow, ‘the endless house’ shudders like an old cuckoo clock that languorously announces every hour. She is vertical only because she is in suspension. Once the bodies that refuse resuscitation match the pitch of the off-beat metronome, the tiny, fairy-skinned motor vibrates toward its anticipated burnout. The empty mother and the lying daughter, the angel with a scythe and the naked firefighter devote themselves to the sexual act of the giver. 
					<br><br>
					The scene after everything is over and ruined; in other words, the scene freed of life and death is rearranged as a deconstructed opera for a short while. Brewed in the respiratory tube of larvae with the curvature of an anal plug, the alcohol undulates among the invited people. The etheric cocktail doped to droop numb eyelids, incite nausea, and disallow death throes. An acrid finish, this fishy-smelling glass. With swollen and biased eyes shut, proudly savor ‘this unbelievable sleep’...
					<br><br>
					Like the fleeting morning light that remains crisp even in the sunset or the belief that energy cannot be harmed, recollect remnants of the happenings that have returned in latency, and send the threats back to the hidden addresses of the tattered nerves. Overworked sleepwalkers now place moments of precarious immersion atop the autopsy table.

			<summary>Post-lesbian Opera, Liquid Computation</summary>
				<p>
					As a director, producer, and developer, Yeonså Cha seeks to devise a new genre that synthesizes ‘liquid computation’ and ‘post-lesbian opera.’

					<ul>
						<li>2022.11 Juicy Mosquito, Live performance, Korea National University of Arts - Main Building Gallery, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea</li>
						<li>2022.01 Every mosquito feels the same, Collaborative solo show, TINC, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Juicy Mosquito begins with a modification of ‘scissoring,’ a type of sexual act involving rubbing. The live performance concerns the guilt and captivation with penetration, and the heightened sense of touch engendered by biased, swollen eyes. It devises an impossible theory of escape for those who have confined themselves.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Subsequently presented as a recorded installation and promised landscape, Every Mosquito is a suspension of bodies and media, like the performers frozen on the salt-partitioned stage. It is a curtain call or an after party–a latent tale of traumas released into the sunshine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Accompanied by the elderly young larvae of which life and death is unknown or which reincarnates countless times, Mosquitolarvajuice begins flaunting insults as trappings. By situating various layers of anesthetized/sedated/sleeping bodies on the stage, we decide to tune into the frequency of creative labor, recovery, and love as vital potentialities. This becomes ‘actionable steps’ for the body, mind, and energy living in exhaustion.
